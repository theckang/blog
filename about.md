Welcome to my blog!  My goal is to provide guides, thoughts, and best practices with big data and infrastructure technologies.  

A little bit about me - I work for Accenture Technology Labs as an architect creating prototypes and delivering pilots from best-of-breed next generation technology solutions.  You can find out more about me and my work experience in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theckang).

Hope it helps, and thanks for reading.
