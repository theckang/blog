Welcome to my blog!  My goal is to provide guides, thoughts, and best practices with big data and infrastructure technologies.  

A little bit about me - I work for Accenture Technology Labs as a developer and architect creating prototypes and delivering pilots with next generation technology solutions.  You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/theckang) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theckang).

Thanks for reading!
